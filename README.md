# OPFW Spec

Specification for the Rhytick OPK engine.

## WIP & Disclaimer

The specification is still being actively developed. It will remain unstable before the first Opticia release. APIs can change at any time, and the documents may also be outdated.

This repository does not contain executable code, i.e. it's only **describing** the APIs which the OPK releases **should** implement.

## Brief

This project is part of the **OPFW Series**. OPFW Series is a set of native libraries and their wrappers to support the run of Opticia, our music based game.

OPFW Spec, stands for 'Specification of OPK Framework', uses TypeScript to describe the interfaces that OPK should implement. When we're referring the world **should**, we are saying that some APIs are mandatory, while some are optional (e.g. comparing `unicorn-file-reader` and `unicorn-explicit-gc`).
